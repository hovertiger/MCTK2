# MCTK2
MCTK2 is a symbolic model checker for multi-agent systems. It has a SMV-like input language, in which each agent is modeled as a module with observability description of variables. It currently supports the verification of CTLK, LTLK and their time-bounded versions. These temporal epistemic logics are model checked based on the observable semantics.
